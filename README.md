# url-shortener
Hey there! Thanks for checking out my GitHub repo. I did this project during my summer 2021 internship at Unit221b, a super cool cybersecurity company named after Sherlock Holmes :) If you're a college/university, employer, or just someone who's curious about my projects, my main project (a super-cool filesystem authenticator) is in a repo called cool-filesystem-authenticator. If you're interested, feel free to check that out as well! 

Purpose of project: Simple Python URL shortener
Functional as-is: Yes (except for sending URLs to your phone--that doesn't work without some Twilio credentials that I had to leave out for confidentiality reasons.)
How to use: You can create a new personal database using your name, and then whenever you access the program it will have saved your previous shortened URLs for you to view. Four functions: Create a short URL from a long URL, insert a short URL to automatically open the original long URL, list all short URLs, insert a short URL to send the long URL to your phone (doesn't work without Twilio credentials) and delete a short URL from the database. Hope you enjoy my project!
